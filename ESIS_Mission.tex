\chapter{First Flight of the EUV Snapshot Imaging Spectrograph (ESIS)}

\section{Abstract}

\section{Introduction}

\section{ESIS Mission}
	Brief description of the instrument, mostly pointing to the instrument paper.  Describe ESIS enough so that the make sense.
	
	Need to consult the instrument paper to see what makes sense here. 
	
\subsection{Summary of Coordinated Data????}
Not much here, but I think it is worth detailing that for the reader.

\section{Data}

\subsection{Level 1 Data}
\subsubsection{Bias Subtraction}
\subsubsection{Gain Correction}
	Get in touch with MSFC about different apparent channel gains.
\subsubsection{Dark Subtraction}

\subsection{Level 3 Data}
\subsubsection{Co-Alignment to AIA 304}
\subsubsection{Quadratic Internal Alignment}
\subsubsection{Vignetting Correction}
\subsubsection{Conversion to Photons}


\section{Inversion Methods}

Possible include other successful inversion methods?

\subsubsection{Multiplicative Algebraic Reconstruction}
	Need to describe the different modes we are running MART in (LGOF vs not), describe the filtering step.  Show 2-D histograms from different modes on IRIS full disk mosaics
	
	Possibly include results with channels missing (left out of inversion)?

\section{Inverted Events}
	For each event I imagine including inverted projections, residuals, Doppler shifts and line widths, and comments on the temporal and spatial evolution.
	
	Another thing that might be fun is including AIA light curves from all channels.
	
	IRIS data seems pretty empty, but there is still hope for Hinode.  Maybe enlist some help to get co-aligned data quickly.
\subsection{Small Explosive Events}
\subsection{The "Main Event"}
