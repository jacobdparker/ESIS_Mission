\section{ESIS Mission}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Brief description of the instrument, mostly pointing to the instrument paper.  Describe ESIS enough so that the data levels make sense. Need to consult the instrument paper to see what fits here. 
        \item ESIS Flight info.  Time, airtime, pointing, stability, etc.  Suggestions welcome here.
        \item Summary of Coordinated Data????
    \end{itemize}
	
\section{Data}

    \subsection{Level 1 Data}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Bias Subtraction
            \item Gain Correction
            
                 Get in touch with MSFC about different apparent channel gains.
            \item Dark Subtraction
        \end{itemize}
       
	       


    \subsection{Level 3 Data}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Co-Alignment to AIA 304
            \item Quadratic Internal Alignment
            \item Vignetting Correction
            \item Conversion to Photons
        \end{itemize}
